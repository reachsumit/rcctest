Featuring a lightweight alloy frame, carbon fiber fork, and mounts for racks and fenders, it's as performance-packed as it is versatile. Not only does a light bike feel better when you're climbing up a hill, but it's also essential when you're carrying your bike up to the 5th floor, and this was at the forefront of the frame design. With a redesigned E5 Alloy frame, the Allez features a class-leading weight. Aggressively thin-walled, yet tough, tubes have been implemented to save weight, as well. Speaking of the fork, entry-level road bikes often times feature either alloy or cheap carbon fiber forks that greatly detract from the overall ride quality. But with a full FACT carbon fiber fork, the Allez is better handling, smoother riding, and lower in weight—floating over rough chip-seal and carving through corners like a slalom skier. For the geometry, Specialized developed the Allez by utilizing the vast Retül fit database. This meant creating a geometry that's sure to cover a broad range of positions, while still providing the performance-minded handling you'd expect from your first bike. This Allez also features integrated rack and fender mounts, allowing you to get weight out of your backpack and on to a lightweight rack when you need it. This not only makes for a good road bike, but it also enables you to transform it into a fast commuter. Along these lines, you'll find plenty of clearance for 28mm tires, so longer rides become far more bearable and city streets much smoother. For the build, this Allez features reliable Shimano Claris shifting, durable Axis Sport alloy wheels, and well-protected Espoir Sport tires. - E5 Premium Aluminum frame features fully manipulated tubing with smooth welds that increase stiffness and efficiency, while looking just as good as it performs. - Specialized FACT carbon, full monocoque fork designed for high-speed handling. - Shimano 2000 Claris STI shifters shift reliably and are ergonomically shaped to fit all hand sizes",5.0,750.0,17,Sport/Performance,http://thebicyclechain.com/images/library/large/specialized-allez-304259-1.jpg

Weight was a large factor in the development, so Specialized took some design cues from the Roubaix with a FACT 9r carbon frame that's one of the lightest in the category. Specialized opted for a new Open Road Geometry. We know what you're thinking, ""it's just another marketing term,"" but they truly did develop an entirely new geometry. Think of it as a road version of modern trail bike geometry.

The geo features a bottom bracket that's over a half-centimeter lower than the previous Diverge, a slacked-out head tube angle, short chainstays, and a short wheelbase. These changes make for a bike that's not only fun in the dirt, but also performs well on the road. There's only so much that wider tires with lower pressures can absorb, so Specialized implemented a new version of the Future Shock into the Diverge design. It not only soaks up bumps with ease, but provides extremely predictable handling.

302292,2018 Specialized Men's Diverge Expert,"The last thing that you want is your bike holding you back from having the ride of your life. If you see rough roads or flowy singletrack, Specialized wants you to ride it, not think, ""That looks fun, but I can't do it on this bike."" They're tired of fun being restricted, and that's why they developed the Diverge Expert. Now, you can get out there and not only explore new roads, but entirely new rides—we promise that the bike won't be a limiting factor. The Diverge frame will comfortably fit up to 700x42mm tires with plenty of room for mud, too. Weight was a large factor in the development, so Specialized took some design cues from the Roubaix with a FACT 9r carbon frame that's one of the lightest in the category. Specialized opted for a new Open Road Geometry. We know what you're thinking, ""it's just another marketing term,"" but they truly did develop an entirely new geometry. Think of it as a road version of modern trail bike geometry. It provides playful handling and predictable steering for endless dirt skids and mid-corner drifts. The geo features a bottom bracket that's over a half-centimeter lower than the previous Diverge, a slacked-out head tube angle, short chainstays, and a short wheelbase. These changes make for a bike that's not only fun in the dirt, but also performs well on the road. There's only so much that wider tires with lower pressures can absorb, so Specialized implemented a new version of the Future Shock into the Diverge design. It not only soaks up bumps with ease, but provides extremely predictable handling. That's because the wheelbase isn't lengthening when you hit a bump, so the front end of the Diverge keeps the same effective head tube angle. In other words, when you dive hard into a turn, you won't be surprised by under steer or sloppy handling. Unlike the original Future Shock, the Diverge's version features a progressive spring that makes this technology more suitable for off-road applications, where stiffer suspension is often needed to soak-up larger bumps and obstacles. Specialized topped it off with three water bottle mounts and mounts for racks and fenders. So while it's one of the most smile-inducing bikes you'll ever shred fire roads on, it's equally adept at bike packing, commuting, or even a spin to your local brewery. The frame, meanwhile, is topped off with a SRAM Force 1 groupset, hydraulic disc brakes, and Roval SLX 24 wheelset with 2Bliss Ready tires.",0.0,4000.0,18,Multi-Speed,http://thebicyclechain.com/images/library/large/specialized-diverge-expert-302292-11.jpg

In the Win Tunnel, every tube shape, trailing edge, and design cue was made for speed. It's also Rider-First Engineered to ensure that every frame size experiences uniform performance, plus front-end stiffness was increased by 30% over the Tarmac. As one of the first elements to hit the wind, current stem and bar offerings cause too much aerodynamic drag. To achieve the best solution, while also interfacing with the frame, they found a negative 17-degree stem was the best option. Most riders aren't flexible enough to ride in such an aggressive position, though, so the Aerofly bars with a positive rise replicates your most efficient position.
